In case of overriding the EDMX File in the future: 

Google's HTML 5 picker does not bind properly with the DateTime values. 

The solution is to add the following annotations to the class of interest

[DisplayFormat(ApplyFormatInEditMode = true, DataFormatString = "{0:yyyy-MM-dd}")]
[DataType(DataType.Date)]


Do NOT change the format string to match how you'd actually like the date to display.
